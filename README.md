This above is the showcase of the frontpage of out website, designed for hotel owners to manage their hotel pictures by uploading, editing, and deleting them as needed. For non-owners, users can search for hotels they wish to visit or book. Although the booking feature will be added in future updates, the site currently includes a map API feature for easy hotel location access. Additionally, customers can leave reviews, including comments and a star rating out of five, after their visit.
